title: 4. from the data set to the distribution, discuss the loss of information and the gain for interpretation.
---
The distribution of statistical data set or population is a listing or function showing all the possible values of the data and how often they occur.

**Loss of information** includes list of the the population(list of names), which means the list of the statistical unit is removed from the distribution table. 
We also loss the association between statistical unit and variables.

### gain of interpretation:-
 -  easy to interpret and they can display large data sets in fairly concise manner
 -  help to identify obvious trends within the data set and can be used to compare data between data sets of the same type.
