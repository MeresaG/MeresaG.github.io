title: 4. from the data set to the distribution, discuss the loss of information and the gain for interpretation.
---
The distribution of statistical data set or population is a listing or function showing all the possible values of the data and how often they occur.

**Loss of information** includes list of the the population(list of names), which means the list of the statistical unit is removed from the distribution table. We also loss the association between statistical unit and variables. 
***Lets take for example our last example from research number 2*** .
Obviously, when we calculate the distribution for our example, we will lose the information who loves which programming language, and we will only have the information which programming language is more popular. So we still have the set of favorite languages, we just don’t have the information who exactly loves which language. On the other hand, this should not be a problem because when we have the distribution, we can calculate and retrieve new and more useful information about the data. Statistics is all about “compressing” a lot of information into a few numbers so our brain can process it more easily.

### gain of interpretation:-
 -  easy to interpret and they can display large data sets in fairly concise manner
 -  help to identify obvious trends within the data set and can be used to compare data between data sets of the same type.
