title: 12. Show the relationships between conditional and marginal frequencies (reasoning on a bivariate distribution) commenting on their meaning.

**conditional frequency** is it’s a fraction that tells you how many members of of a group have a particular characteristic. More technically, it is the ratio of a frequency in the center of the table to the frequency’s row total or column total.

**marginal frequency** The cells which contain the sum of the initial counts by row and by column are called marginal frequencies. Note that the lower right corner cell (the total of all the counts) is not labeled as a marginal frequency.

**Conditional frequency**  =  the number of member of one group given that the total number of another category.
**Marginal Frequency** = the total number of one class or category
