title: 25. Do a research about the most interesting statistical charts and make plans to include them in your own personal library.

One goal of **statistics** is to present data in a meaningful way. Often, data sets involve millions (if not billions) of values. This is far too many to print out in a journal article or sidebar of a magazine story. That's where graphs can be invaluable, allowing statisticians to provide a visual interpretation of complex numerical stories. Types of graphs that are commonly used in statistics. 


### 1. Pareto Diagram or Bar Graph 


A Pareto diagram or bar graph is a way to visually represent â€‹qualitative data. Data is displayed either horizontally or vertically and allows viewers to compare items, such as amounts, characteristics, times, and frequency. The bars are arranged in order of frequency, so more important categories are emphasized. By looking at all the bars, it is easy to tell at a glance which categories in a set of data dominate the others.

 ### 2. Pie Chart or Circle Graph 
 
 
 Another common way to represent data graphically is a pie chart. It gets its name from the way it looks, just like a circular pie that has been cut into several slices. This kind of graph is helpful when graphing qualitative data, where the information describes a trait or attribute and is not numerical. Each slice of pie represents a different category, and each trait corresponds to a different slice of the pie; some slices usually noticeably larger than others. By looking at all of the pie pieces, you can compare how much of the data fits in each category, or slice.

 ### 3. Histogram
 
 
 A histogram in another kind of graph that uses bars in its display. This type of graph is used with quantitative data. Ranges of values, called classes, are listed at the bottom, and the classes with greater frequencies have taller bars.
