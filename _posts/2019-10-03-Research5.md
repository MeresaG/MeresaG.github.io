title: 5. Formal properties of the relative frequency
---
**A frequency distribution** is a distribution that shows how often something happens. 
with relative frequency distribution, we don’t want to know the counts. We want to know the percentages.

Relative frequency of a class = **class frequency/n**, where **Class frequency** refers to the number of observations in each class; **n** represents the total number of observations in the entire data set. 


### below are the four properties of relative frequency.
1. the relative frequency of a class is greater than or equal to zero(fi >= 0).
2. the relative frequency of a population is 1 (fn = 1)
3. there is no common relative frequency between classes(i.e fi ∩ fj = Ø)
4. freq(Ci ⋃ Cj) = freq(Ci) + freq(Cj)
