title: 7. The most important families of theoretical distribution.
---
**Theoretical distribution** is when you **know** what the **distribution** is and its **parameters**

**Empirical distribution** is when we start **knowing nothing**. What we have is a collection of observations, and we want to try and derive some knowledge from that collection. 

### Continuous distribution

1. **Uniform distribution:-** is a type of distribution in which all outcomes are equally likely; each variable has the same probability that it will be the outcome. A deck of cards has within it uniform distributions because the likelihood of drawing a heart, a club, a diamond or a spade is equally likely. A coin also has a uniform distribution because the probability of getting either heads or tails in a coin toss is the same.
2. **Normal distribution:-** Normal distribution, also known as the Gaussian distribution, is a theoretical distribution that is symmetric about the mean, showing that data near the mean are more frequent in occurrence than data far from the mean.
 3. **chi square**
 4. **gamma**
 5. **beta**
 6. **exponential** 
 
 ### Discrete distribution

  1. **Boolean:â€“** a distribution with value either true or flase.
  2. **Binomial:-** is a distribution that has the following properties: 

    - The experiment consists of n repeated trials.
    - Each trial can result in just two possible outcomes. We call one of these outcomes a success and the other, a failure.
    - The probability of success, denoted by P, is the same on every trial.
    - The trials are independent that is, the outcome on one trial does not affect the outcome on other trials.

  3. **Multinomial:-** is almost identical with one main difference: a binomial experiment can have two outcomes, while a multinomial experiment can have multiple outcomes.
