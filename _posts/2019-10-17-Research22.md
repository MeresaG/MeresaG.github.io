title: Insight 1: Show how the general formula Mr encompasses various types of common averages and including (as limit) the geometric average (have a look at the proof)

If p is a non-zero real number, and x1 , â€¦ , xn are positive real numbers, then the generalized mean or power mean with exponent p of these positive real numbers is:

  For p = 0 we set it equal to the geometric mean (which is the limit of means with exponents approaching zero, as proved below):

  Special cases:-
