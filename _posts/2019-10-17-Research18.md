title: 18. Find out about the various types of averages and find several real-world examples where they “naturally” occur
---
As we concluded in various researches before, when we have raw data, it is difficult to learn anything from it, unless and until the data is arranged in proper manner. When the data have been arranged into a frequency distribution, the information contained in the data could be easily understood.

Now, let’s move one step ahead and say that we want to find a single value, which will in some way represent all the values in our distribution. A value which could be useful for us, and do exactly what we want is called an average. There are several types of averages, and here are the most used ones with their explanations:

    Arithmetic mean – This is the most commonly used average. Usually, it is referred as the average or simply mean. The arithmetic mean is defined as the value obtained by dividing the sum of values by their number or quantity.Following is the mathematical formula for the arithmetic mean:

One of the most known examples of the use of this mean (at least among us students and of course, the teachers) is the process of calculating the average grade for a course. Let’s say that we have 5 courses: English, Mathematics, Geography, History and Italian. For these 5 courses, one student has 5 grades (on the scale of 5 to 10): 10, 9, 9, 8, 7. The average grade for this student would be calculated as: (10+9+9+8+7)/5=8.6.

    Weighted Arithmetic Mean – When the values are not of equal importance, we assign them certain numerical values to express their relative importance. These numerical values are called weights. If X1, X2, ……, Xk have weights W1, W2, ……., W3, then the weighted arithmetic mean or the weighted mean, can be calculated by the following formula:

Let’s use the same example as before, just with a little modification. Let’s add the weights to the subjects respectively: 5,4,3,1,2. Thus, the weighted mean can be calculated as: (10*5+9*4+9*3+8*1+7*2)/(5+4+3+1+2)= 9

    Geometric mean – The geometric mean, G, of a set of n positive values X1, X2, ……, Xn is the nth root of the product of the values. Mathematically the formula for geometric mean will be as follows:

Geometric mean can, for example, be used to find growth in bacteria. The growth of a bacteria increases each time and geometric mean can help us. For example, if a strain of bacteria increases its population by 20% in the first hour, 30% in the next hour and 50% in the next hour, we can find out an estimate of the mean percentage growth in population using Geometric mean.

    Harmonic mean – The harmonic mean, H, of a set of n values X1, X2, ……, Xn is the reciprocal of the arithmetic mean of the reciprocals of the values. Mathematically, the formula for harmonic mean will be as follows:

For example, if in the first try a typist types 400 words in 50 minutes, in second try he types the same words (400) in 40 minutes and in third try he takes 30 minutes to type the 400 words. Th average time of typing can be calculated by using the harmonic mean.

    Quadratic mean – The quadratic mean (also called the root mean square) is another type of average. It represents the square root of the mean of the squares of the numbers in the set. It can be calculated with the following formula:

A real life example of the use of the quadratic mean can be found in calculating the size of a signal. The term “size of a signal” is used to represent “strength of the signal”. It is crucial to know the “size” of a signal used in a certain application.
