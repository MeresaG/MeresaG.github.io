title: 17. How to define and use a bitmap and graphics object and animated display of image in a picture box using a timer.
---

1. **Define The Bitmap**
    - b = New BitMap(width, height)
 The bitmap object constructor takes two inputs: the width and the height of the bitmap. If we are using a PictureBox, the input arguments can be the width and height of our PictureBox.
 
2. **Creation of the Graphics Object**
    - g = graphics.fromImage(b)
3. **Creation of the Scene**(Drawing of various charts)
4. **Display of the bit map on the screen or picture box**
    - Me.PictureBox.Image = b
5. ***Time or Animation loop*
    - tick()
