title: 14.  Discuss relationship between the concept of relative frequency and probability.
---

If an action is repeated n times and a certain event occurred b times then the ratio b/n is called the **relative frequency**.
Where as **theoretical probability** it is used to determine the number of ways that the event can occur if an experiment is repeated a large number of times. The relative frequency is an estimate of the probability of an event.
